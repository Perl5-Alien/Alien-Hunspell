0.03_01   2016-01-04 20:44:08 -0500
  - Apply patch to expose add_dic via the C interface
    https://github.com/hunspell/hunspell/pull/355
    optionally used by Text::Hunspell::FFI
  - Included additional Test::Alien based tests.
    These are required for dev releases, but may
    be optional (for now) on production releases.

0.02_02   2015-12-23 20:01:41 -0700
  - Better C++ diagnostics
  - Compile test is mandatory (t/compile.t) but
    the link/run stage is not mandatory because
    C++ support in Test::CChecker is flaky, and
    doesn't resemble how Alien::Hunspell is used
    in practice anyway.
